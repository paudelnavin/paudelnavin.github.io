<h4>Question 1) solution:</h4>
<p><b>NOTE:</b>Code written in a pair of curly braces (this is a pair of curly braces{ }) is considered a
    block.
    <br><br>
    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of
    their scope before code execution. If variable is declared as "var" then it is assigned as undefined
    and if varaible is declared as let and const then javascript will never define it as undefined.
    Also function expression too assigned as undefined. But for function declarations it will assign a
    function name as function.
    <br><br>
    <b>1)Ans)</b> document.write(x) = undefined<br>
    document.write(a) = 8<br>
    document.write(b) = 8<br>
    document.write(b) = 9<br>
    document.write(b) = 10<br>
    document.write(x) = 1<br>
    <br><br>
    <b>Explanation:</b>
    first during creation: hosting is done: i.e. a = undefined, b=undefined, c=undefined but if we use
    let/const then javascript will never assign those variable as undefined.<br><br>

    During execution: a=5, b=10, c=fn() and x=1<br><br>

    After that c(8,9,10) is called and it will go inside function var c = function(a,b,c){}<br><br>

    now again hoisting is done i.e. f=undefined, x=undefined and
    value is assigned to a, b,c as a= 8, b=9, c=10 because it is sent through function<br><br>

    document.write(x) = undefined<br><br>
    document.write(a) = 8<br><br>

    now function f(a,b,c) is called and will go inside function and again hoisting is done: x=undefined<br>
    value is assigned to a, b,c as a= 8, b=9, c=10 because it is sent through function<br><br>
    b=a i.e. b=8<br><br>
    document.write(b) = 8<br><br>
    b=c i.e. b=10<br><br>
    x=5<br><br>

    will go out of function and in closure outer function cannot access inside function variables but
    inside function can access outer function varaible<br><br>
    so here a= 8, b=9, c=10, x= undefined<br><br>
    document.write(b) = 9<br><br>
    x=10<br><br>

    will go outside function and same as above for closure<br><br>
    so a=5, b=10, x=1, c=fn()<br><br>
    document.write(b) = 10<br><br>
    document.write(x) = 1</p><br><br>

<h4>Question 2) solution:</h4>
<b>Global Scope:</b> There is only one Global scope throughout a JavaScript document. A variable is in the
    Global scope if itâ€™s defined outside of a function. We can also access and alter any variable declared in a
    global scope from any other scope.<br><br>

<b>Local Scope:</b> Variables declared within a function are in the local scope. Local scope is also called
    function scope because local scope is created by functions in Javascript. Variables in the local scope
    are only accessible within the function in which they are defined, i.e they are bound to their
    respective functions each having different scopes. This allows us to create variables that have the
    same name and can be used in different functions.<br><br>

<h4>Question 3) solution:</h4>
<b>Note:</b> when we declare global variable in javascript, we can access it from inside a function.
    But if we create a variable inside the scope of the function with the same name as a globalVariable,
    we lose access to the value of globalVariable inside the scope of the function. So below answer is
    written with an assumption that inside function doesnot have same name of varaible as a global varaible
    have.<br><br>

    a)No<br><br>
    b)Yes<br><br>
    c)No<br><br>
    d)Yes<br><br>
    e)Yes<br><br>

<h4>Question 4) solution:</h4>
    81 and 25 respectively <br><br>

<b>Explanation:</b>
    First hositing will be done i.e. x=undefined<br><br>
    now, execution will happen then x=9<br><br>
    document.write(myFunction()) line will call myFunction() and go inside it and function will return 81<br><br>
    After that x=5<br><br>
    again, document.write(myFunction()) line will call myFunction() and go inside it and function will
    return 25<br><br>


<h4>Question 5) solution:</h4>
    10<br><br>

<b>Explanation</b><br><br>
    first hoisting is done i.e. x=undefined<br><br>
    after execuiton, x=1<br><br>
    bar() function is called then again hoisting is done<br><br>
    so x=undefined<br><br>
    now !foo means it will return true for every "false" value i.e.(empty string, 0, null, false, undefined, NaN). Here x= undefined and will return true. So it will go isnide if fucntion and value of x is assigned as x=10<br><br>
    then it will alert as 10<br><br>
